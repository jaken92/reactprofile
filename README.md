# Reactprofile

A web presentation of me as a developer.

This project has been created with React, Typescript and styled components. I have used additional packages such as TanStackQuery, React Final Form and React Router. 

The contact form is connected to a [NodeJS](https://github.com/jaken92/NodeProfile) api where sendGrid is utilized to send emails. 

Check out the deployed website [here](https://petterjakobsson.netlify.app/).

This project is still under development and will be updated continously...
